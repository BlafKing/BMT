# Blafking's Merge Tool (BMT)

This is a custom python script I wrote that merges multiple .var files into a single .var package.

Each .var file contains a meta.json file which needs to define all the content and dependencies that are inside the package.
This script combines all the meta.json files into a single file and copies all the files & folders from the selected .var packages into one without causing any duplicates!

How to use:
1. Simply open BMT.exe (or BMT.py if you have python installed and know how to use it)
2. Select all the .var files you want to merge into one.
3. Select a save location and name for the new .var file
4. Profit :)
