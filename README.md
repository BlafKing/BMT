# Blafking's Merge Tool (BMT)

This is a custom python script I wrote that merges multiple .var files into a single .var package.

It does this by unpacking and combining all the files into a new .var package and by creating a new meta.json file that refers to all the combined content and dependencies without any duplicates!


How to use:
1. Simply open BMT.exe (or BMT.py if you have python installed and know how to use it)
2. Select all the .var files you want to merge into one.
3. Select a save location and name for the new .var file
4. Profit :)
